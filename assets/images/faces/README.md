# Face Photos for Dancing Elves

Place photos of people's faces here to have them appear on dancing Christmas elves!

## How It Works

The Christmas card will automatically:
1. Load all image files from this folder
2. Place each face on a Christmas elf body
3. Animate the elves dancing around the screen

## Requirements

**Image Format:**
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Recommended: PNG with transparent background for best results
- Square images work best (1:1 aspect ratio)

**Image Size:**
- Recommended dimensions: 200x200 to 500x500 pixels
- Keep file size under 200KB per image
- Compress images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) if needed

**Naming:**
- Use any filename (e.g., `john.jpg`, `mary.png`, `dad.jpg`)
- Avoid special characters in filenames
- The card will load all images automatically

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Face Photos:**
   - Use clear, well-lit photos
   - Face should be centered in the image
   - Close-up headshots work best
   - Smiling faces look more festive!

2. **Background Removal (Optional):**
   - For best results, use photos with transparent backgrounds
   - Use free tools like [Remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/)
   - Or use circular/oval cropping

3. **Quantity:**
   - Add 3-8 faces for a fun, festive look
   - Too many faces (10+) might clutter the screen
   - You can add as many as you like!

## Example Filenames

```
faces/
├── mom.jpg
├── dad.png
├── sister.jpg
├── brother.png
├── grandma.jpg
└── friend.png
```

## No Faces? No Problem!

If you don't add any face photos, the elves will still appear with default Christmas decorations or you can simply have the card without elves.
